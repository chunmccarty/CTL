Q(qualaid): You probably qualify as indigent because you receive public assistance. See <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(cpymtbht2vsgbwl10diluilf))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-780-991" target=_new>Michigan Indigent Defense Commission Act</a>.

Q(qualciv): You probably qualify as indigent since you earn less than 140% of the poverty line. See <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(cpymtbht2vsgbwl10diluilf))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-780-991" target=_new>Michigan Indigent Defense Commission Act</a>.

Q(noqualciv): You probably won't qualify as indigent since you earn more than 140% of the poverty line. See <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(cpymtbht2vsgbwl10diluilf))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-780-991" target=_new>Michigan Indigent Defense Commission Act</a>.
